My research focuses on **heavy-quark physics** and **hadron structure**, using Lattice QCD to provide first-principles predictions for form factors and Standard Model parameters. The underlying goal 
is to support and interpret experimental results, providing theoretical input for non-perturbative quantities and helping to shed light on existing anomalies that may signal new physics.

<!-- My main PhD project focuses on the study of inclusive semi-leptonic decays of $B_{(s)}$
mesons through Lattice QCD simulations. 

Precise theoretical predictions for particle physics models are key ingredients for pushing forward our
understanding of Nature. While our current mathematical formulation - the Standard Model - has
proven to be extremely successful, experiments have recently started to show deviations from it in
sectors involving particles containing heavy quarks, as for example $B$ mesons. \
In this project we propose to address the non-perturbative calculation of the decay rate of the inclusive
semi-leptonic $B_{(s)}$ (and $D_{(s)}$) mesons decay in the Standard Model using theoretical and numerical
techniques available from lattice QCD. 
In particular, the project aims to predict the ratio between the decay rate of the mesons and some
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix elements, specifically $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$. \
These results will represent the first fully non-perturbative theoretical predictions for
such quantities and may eventually provide new insight into the long-standing tension between the
inclusive and exclusive determination of these CKM matrix elements. -->
