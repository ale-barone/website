title: ABOUT ME
description: Short CV
---

I grew up in the italian side of the Alps in a small city called Aosta. This is where
my love for mountains has its roots (as well as my suspiciousness for the seaside), not to mention my
<a href="https://www.greundzo.com/chi-cos-e-il-greundzo" target="_blank">greundzo</a>
attitude (just joking).
I left after high school to start university: I moved first to Pavia for my bachelor
and then to Bologna for my master.
I eventually ended up in the UK to continue with a PhD. <br>
I love travelling and exploring new cities. Sarcasm and dark humour are
a lifestyle for me: I wind down by watching cartoons for adults like 
The Simpsons and Family Guy.
I am passionate about music, in particular blues, rock and metal. I've been playing
electric guitar half my life now, and few are the days where I don't pick it up
to play at least few notes. Don't be fooled though, if I were any good I would
be a rockstar...
