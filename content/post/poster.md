This is a full text description of the poster I presented
at the Doctoral Research Poster Showcase. This is intended to be a very general
introduction for non practictioner.

### Introduction

Particle physics is the study of the tiniest elements in the whole Universe.
Most of the subatomic particles gather together to form composite objects:
some of these form the ordinary matter that we see and touch every day.
A very important family of elementary particles is populated by the so called "quarks".
There are in total six quarks, which can bind together very strongly to form heavier particles called hadrons.

You've surely met the most famous among them: protons and neutrons, which are the constituents of all the objects that surround us.
A whole collection of hadrons exists, such that phycists used to refer to it as a "Particle Zoo".
Almost all of them, though, live for a small fraction of a second before decaying into different lighter particles.
The study and understanding of these disintegrations is an essential key to build a mathematical description of the particle world.

Our current formulation is known as "Standard Model", and it encodes the information of all the known particles.
In the past decades, it allowed us to predict a wide variety of new particles and explain the behaviours and interactions of a wide variety of particles.

In my research, I study the theory of some hadrons decays within the framework provided by this model.
Indeed, while the Standard Model has proven to be extremely successful in explaining a huge range of phenomena, physicists are well aware that it's not the end of the story.

For instance, experiments recently started to show some hints of deviation from the model, especially in processes involving hadrons containg the so called "bottom quark". To tell you the truth, we don't yet understand the source of these discrepancies: that's why we call them "anomalies". To further investigate these anomalies we need two ingredients: more precise experimental data together with more accurate theoretical predictions.


In my PhD project, I focus on performing precise theoretical calculations of decays of a set of hadrons containing the bottom quark. These computations are very hard to solve with pen and paper: the only possibility is to rely on numerical simulations with the help of supercomputers. 

Starting from the pure theoretical model, we translate the mathematical equations into a code that a computer can handle and digest. For example, instead of dealing with a continous and infinite space, we pretend that our particles live in a finite cubic lattice, where they can jump from one site to the other. A challenging aspect of these tasks is the accuracy of the final results.
In order to get predictions as precise as possible these computations need to be iterated many times, so they can easily run for weeks!


The final goal is to extract numerical values for some Standard Model parameters which may shed some light on the bottom quark anomalies: 
if confirmed, these could lead the path to extend the Standard Model of particle physics and our  understanding of the Universe.
