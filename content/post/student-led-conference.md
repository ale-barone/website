I have succesfully organised my first conference 
"From Particle Physics to Gravitation: the Crossover with Data Science", check the
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pp2g/home" target="_blank">website</a>!

The conference addressed the necessity of Data Science and High Performance
Computers in Theoretical Physics, and covered topics from particle physics - such
as phenomenology and lattice QCD - to gravitation and cosmology,
with a particular focus on the application of techniques from fields like
artificial intelligence, machine learning and data generation.


This event has been sponsored by SEPnet (South-East Physics Network),
which every year gives the opportunity to
postgraduate students to organise networking events among the universities
of the network. The scheme awards students with the funding and guidance necessary
to create a 2-day conference on a chosen subject.
